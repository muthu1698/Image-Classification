# Image-Classification
Before we begin, let us understand the dataset.  In this article, we will be solving the popular MNIST problem. It is a digit recognition task wherein we have to classify the images of handwritten digits into either of the 10 classes which are  0 to 9.

In the MNIST dataset, we have images of digits that were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size, and centered. Subsequently, each image is a 28 by 28-pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard split of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it.

Now, we have understood the dataset as well. So, letâ€™s build our image classification model using CNN in PyTorch and TensorFlow. We will start with implementation in PyTorch. We will be implementing these models in Kaggle which provides free GPU to run these deep learning models.
